        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the best borscht I have ever eaten. Double the recipe, because it freezes well.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>¾ tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup finely chopped carrots</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper, divided</li>
            <li>½ stalk celery, chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium beet</li>
            <li>½ cup canned peeled and diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 potatoes, quartered</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1½ cups canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 cups finely shredded cabbage, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>¾ cup diced potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place water, salt, carrots, 1/2 of the bell pepper, celery, beet, tomatoes, and quartered potatoes in a large stock pot over high heat. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Melt 1/3 cup butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Saute onions in butter until tender, approximately 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove 1/2 cup of sauce from skillet, and set aside. Stir half of the cabbage into the skillet with remaining sauce, and continue simmering 5 minutes more, or until tender.</li>
            <li>Remove beet from boiling liquid and discard. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon or tongs, and place in a bowl with remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and the cream. Mash together until smooth.</li>
            <li>Return the 1/2 cup of reserved onion-tomato sauce to the stock pot. Stir in diced potatoes, and simmer until just tender but still firm, approximately 5 minutes. Increase heat to a low boil, and stir in remaining cabbage, tomato sauce, and mashed potatoes. Reduce heat and simmer a few minutes more. Stir in remaining bell pepper, season with black pepper, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
